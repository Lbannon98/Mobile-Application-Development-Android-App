Delicious Dishes in an Android Mobile Application that displays a number of meals that have been added to a Firebase Database.
This application has a very attractive front end by using the CardView. Each meal contains information on the meal name, meal image
and a meal link. This meal link leads to Donal Skeehan's website, for the user to avail of the ingredients and recipes.

The user has the ability to add and remove meals from their Favourites. This will add and remove from the Firebase Database in a
realtime fashion.
